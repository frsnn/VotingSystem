        name: "SMA Connect",
        aim: "Nowadays, the number of SMA patients in Turkey has increased a lot. Hopeless families are working to collect money for the treatment of their child. Medicine and surgery prices are too expensive for the families to effort. That is the reason we witness that people are trying to find volunteers at donation points, social media and public transportation vehicles. Unfortunately, there are some poisonous mentalities acting like patients’ parents to steal volunteers’ money. This situation makes volunteers feel uncomfortable and turn their donating desire off. Our project aims to minimize the doubt of the volunteers while creating a new and safe area for the patients to collect their donations more easily.",
        importance: "According to the data of the ministry of health, approximately 150 babies are born with SMA disease. Every single baby can change the world in a good way, if we give them the opportunity to grow up healthy. Since the medicine prices are too high, donations are taking up an important space in the treatment process. In order to increase the number of donations, this project will make people more willing to donate. This mobile application will be a safety place with certificated IBAN numbers and the approvements of doctors. Therefore, the volunteers are able to make their donation with peace of mind. This official donation application will destroy donators’ hesitations of giving their money to a possible fake patient. So that, after breaking the question marks of the volunteers, this project has the potential to save thousands of lives.",

Users can connect with students by following various communities, such as “Chess Club” or “Robotics Club”. Moreover, they can join to seek assistance and ask questions regarding their courses or maybe even a university issue in a group chat. Lastly, the project will allow students to post diverse types of media on a centralized feed page. While the project resembles platforms such as “Facebook” in concept, it is specifically designed for the use of Bilgi students.",
        importance: "The significance of this project is its potential to provide support for students in need of help, especially first-year students. First-year students often require help and a community page can serve as a platform to connect students. The project will facilitate the establishment of new connections with other students from other departments. For instance, it can connect students with shared interests, such as students with an interest in machine learning. And they can start helping each other or even start projects. Also, for every course given at Bilgi tends to have a certain 'WhatsApp' group created by a random student, and there exists hundreds of them. It would be very convenient if all those groups can be found in one place, So whenever a student is in need of help in any certain course they could simply search for such group on the platform. \nLink: https://github.com/makifcevik/learnbook" ,

        importance: "Turkey is one of the most important seismic active countries in the world. Turkey is between three major tectonic plates and compressed towards the north by Arabian and African plates. This region is the most active area of the Mediterranean region in terms of earthquake activity. The observed earthquakes are generated as a result of the collision of the Arabian and African plates with Eurasia. Many disasters happened in Turkey through the time, and regardless of their severity, most of the time telecommunications networks collapse, and communication is disrupted as the capacity of telephone providers is exceeded. Communication is attempted to be carried out over internet, through social media, and in the meantime, problems such as misinformation and manipulation are encountered during the dissemination of information. Problems that arise and hinder rescue efforts after natural disasters such as corruption of information and incorrect information being sent to professional help teams. One of the main importance of this project is enhanced communication, even for the small scale of emergency events, it is possible for to collapse of telecommunications networks to occur due to high demand. It is beneficial to collect inquiries via an internet connection and collect them on a single centralised platform to have better management of the resources and allocate supplies and equipment.",

In this way, students will have the chance to evaluate and develop their projects from different perspectives, and at the same time, they will contribute to a broader learning environment by increasing the overall interaction of their projects. The project also allows students to learn from each other while working on their projects. Each student will be able to view their own project not only as an evaluation tool but also as an opportunity to learn different approaches and techniques by examining other projects. This will enrich student interaction and learning experience in the classroom. The 5-star evaluation system included in the project will provide quantitative feedback to students and they will have the opportunity to improve their projects accordingly.",
